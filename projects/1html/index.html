		<h2>Why is pizza so great?</h2>

		<p>Pizza is great because it is food. Food is necessary to survive, in most cases. Pizza is a combination of dough, tomato sauce, and cheese, at its core. The dough is stretched and flattened into a disc. These ingredients are then stacked upon each other and cooked into an oven. Often times, other ingredients may be placed on top while cooking in the oven, to modify the flavor to someone's particular desires.</p>
