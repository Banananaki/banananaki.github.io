                        <h5>Hello. My name is Joshua Roberts. I am currently 27 years old. I am an avid gamer, and a completionist. I am in the process of learning coding so I may pursue a career in a technological field of some kind. I am also learning Japanese, and would like to learn piano and start making music soon. <br><br>
                        This website is a sample of some of the things I can code, and I'm using this as a personal portfolio of my coding experience, and my journey through learning code. Some of the examples on the portfolio and projects pages may not be anything fancy, but it shows where I started and where I am now, to some extent.
                        <br><br>
                        I would like to thank you for your time in reading this, and checking out my project page, and hope this website is displaying properly for you.</h5>

                        <h5>I don't have much of a presence on social media, however, I do have some links I think are important. At the bottom, you can find most of my accounts for various platforms, such as Facebook, Youtube, Github, SoundCloud, Spotify, and Twtich. The facebook link is my personal facebook. My youtube channel mostly has silly gaming content that I've found, or short clips of me doing cool stuff. My github page has the source for this website, as well as other projects I may have contributed to. My SoundCloud page has some of the music I've made in the past, and I may make more music in the future. My Spotify page has playlists of the music I enjoy listening to, two of the main ones are listed on the left side of this page. Finally, my Twitch page is where I might be streaming video games sometime in the future. I plan on speedrunning a few games, but who knows if I'll actually commit to it.
                        <br><br>
                        Below are my Gaming accomplishments. You can click on these banners to visit my PSNprofiles page where you can see all of the trophies I've acquired while playing games on PS3, PS4, and PSVita. That is my current PSN tag. I've also included my Nintendo Switch online ID, which I don't play much of, but you might find me online.
